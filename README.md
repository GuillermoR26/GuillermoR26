👨‍💻 About me :
Aspiring QA tester / Software tester. I have always been interested in technology related topics, until now I could manage the time to make my first step.

🔭 Having completed my QA tester engineer tripleten course and with a degree in aeronautical engineering, I hope to demonstrate my skills in the technology field combining the experience I have developed in both fields and give favorable results where I develop.

🌱 Tools such as: Selenium, SQL language and Python, using the Pythest and Request libraries, as well as Manual Testing tools, such as Jira, Postman and Android Studio.
